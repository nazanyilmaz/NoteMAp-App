##NoteMap-App
<p>
   I developed a NoteMap-App using React Native features. I added the application name and logo. I created a splash screen. I added users with Firebase database. You can log in to the application with this user information. You can select a place on the map and add a note there. You can add it to favorites. You can log out of the application and log in again whenever you want with the same email and password.</p>
